                    George Zacharias was the first stationmaster to occupy the
                    Stationmaster's house when it was built in 1866.

          <p class="paragraph-text">The father of George Adam Zacharias was Samuel Zacharias who was born August 26, 1811 
            in Berks County. After Samuel moved further west to Dauphin County, he married Maria C. Milleisen who was born 
            September 24, 1815 in Dauphin County. They were married in Dauphin County on May 2, 1833. George was born May 6, 1835 
            in Dauphin County. He was the first born and had seven siblings including David Joseph; John Jacob; Samuel M.; Mary C.; 
            Margaret M.; Charles R.; and Robert B. It is interesting to note that Margaret married Edward M. Eberly, 
            the son of Levi Eberly who was the son of David Eberly and Catharine Frankenberger, the daughter of George Frankenberger 
            who owned the Tavern.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">Samuel Zacharias and his family moved to Cumberland County between 1841 and 1847. 
            Samuel became a grains dealer and was well known in the Mechanicsburg. George married Mary Ann Riegel, 
            daughter of John Adam Riegel, on October 13, 1857. John Riegel was the son of Adam Riegel, one of the founding 
            fathers of Mechanicsburg and business partner with John Coover, another founding father. According to Hauck’s 
            1876 Directory of Mechanicsburg, George Zacharias occupied the position of general freight and ticket agent at 
            the Mechanicsburg Cumberland Valley Railroad Station since 1860. The 1860 Census records George as a commercial 
            merchant. The 1870 and 1880 Censuses record George as a telegraph operator.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">In addition to his work, George was involved in the Holy Royal Arch Chapter Mason Lodge No. 
            302 of Mechanicsburg. He was conferred the Honorary Degree of Mark Master Mason and was accepted as a Most Excellent 
            Master Mason on July 13, 1866. He was also a member of the National Grange of Patron of Husbandry. 
            George was part of the Mechanicsburg Chapter in charge of erecting the Centennial Encampment near Philadelphia 
            for the accommodation of fellow Grangers attending the Centennial Exposition of 1876. Along with his father, Samuel, 
            who was a grains dealer and lived at 24 East Main Street, George was a member of the Mechanicsburg Building 
            Association which was organized in 1868. George was also a member of the Cumberland County Horticultural Society 
            and in 1868 was a member of its Executive Committee. In 1872 George held the position of Assistant Burgess of 
            Mechanicsburg working for J. Milliesen, Chief Burgess. George and Mary had two children. Frank was born on August 30, 
            1861 and Gertrude was born in October 1863. All resided at the Stationmaster House and were frequently joined by 
            John Jacob, George’s younger brother. George and his family remained in Mechanicsburg and worked for the Cumberland 
            Valley Railroad until 1878.

          <p class="paragraph-text">At that time George moved to Harper County, Kansas. He became the deputy register of deeds and 
            in 1880 he was elected Register of Deeds. His son, Frank became a clerk working under his father. 
            George remained in that position for four years until 1884. At this time he retired from active business and 
            returned to Mechanicsburg. His son, Frank, remained in Kansas and became successful in banking.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">George, Mary and Gertrude resided at the corner of South High and West Locust Streets. 
            The property had originally belonged to Samuel Zacharias and was sold to George before he went to Kansas. 
            During his absence, the property was sold by Sheriff Gill to John Riegel in trust for his daughter, Mary Ann Zacharias. 
            Gertrude attended public schools of Mechanicsburg and graduated from the Mechanicsburg High School in 1881.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">In October of 1907, Mr. and Mrs. George A. Zacharias celebrated their Golden Wedding 
            Anniversary in the presence of invited family and friends at their residence on South High Street.
            George and Mary suffered a tragic loss in 1916. Their daughter, Gertrude, who never married, died on February 8, 
            1916 at the age of 51 years. Gertrude had been ill for some time from a complication of diseases. 
            She was buried in Chestnut Hill Cemetery.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">In 1921, Mary Zacharias suffered a paralytic stroke, which weakened her constitution. 
            However, she lived until one month short of her 90th birthday. She died at her home on South High Street on 
            July 9, 1926. George joined her in death a few hours later. Both were buried in the Chestnut Hill Cemetery 
            having been joined in matrimony 68 years.

          <p class="paragraph-text">Late in the summer of 1899, a public drinking fountain was placed on the southeast corner 
            of the Mechanicsburg town square in front of Franklin Hall and the Market House. It was considered a very simple 
            model being made of brown sandstone. The fountain was the first gift given to Mechanicsburg by the Mechanicsburg 
            Women’s Club which had been organized three years earlier. When it was installed the fountain cost $54.42, and later, 
            for the winter months when it was not in use, a cover was made for it and the fountain was painted for which the club 
            paid an additional $1.75.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">Several years later, a Women’s Club member reported that the public fountain was in good 
            condition and thus would cool the thirst of many a wayfarer and many a weary animal. However, by the end of 1906 
            when Mechanicsburg was preparing to celebrate its centennial, the fountain had become damaged and the Women’s Club 
            was considering replacing it with a “handsome new one” for which the members were prepared to pay as much as $300. 
            The members wished to have it formally unveiled and presented to the Borough during its 100th anniversary celebration.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">The Club members were successful in obtaining enough voluntary subscriptions from the 
            townspeople, to replace the fountain to commemorate the centennial. A new iron structure costing two hundred and 
            eighty-two dollars, with troughs for man, horse and dog, was placed near the site of the old one and opened for 
            public use on the 14th of August 1907. This project was completed through the energy and support of the Women’s 
            Civic Committee. The assistance of the Mechanicsburg Water Company, the Franklin Hall and Market Association, 
            the Borough fathers and citizens were also greatly appreciated. This cast iron fountain stood on a site in front 
            of the current day PNC Bank, formerly the First Bank and Trust Company.

          <p class="paragraph-text">During the Borough Council meeting of September 2, 1926, there were discussions 
            concerning the removal of Franklin Hall. The Property Commission reported that permission had been granted 
            to store the clock from Franklin Hall, at the High School Building without charge. The Light Committee reported 
            the lighting equipment was moved from Franklin Hall to the Police Headquarters. However, no mention was made of 
            the public fountain that was in front of Franklin Hall. Franklin Hall was then torn down.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p class="paragraph-text">In a letter from Charles Eberly, Treasurer of the First Bank and Trust Company, 
            to Mr. George Z. Fishel, Secretary of the Borough Council dated April 6, 1927 described that the Bank had discussed 
            the fountain with Miss Clara G. Titzel, President of the Women’s Club of Mechanicsburg, and she reported that the 
            fountain had been turned over to the Borough years ago.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">While preparing the pavement in front of the First Bank and Trust Company building 
            that had been erected on the site of Franklin Hall in 1927, the two telephone companies and the Electric Light 
            Company cooperated and moved their poles back on the line which left the fountain standing alone with the water 
            container protruding over the curb line.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">At the Borough Council meeting held on April 7, 1927, Mr. Aulthouse of the Property 
            Committee recommended the removal of the public fountain which stood on the square.The motion for removal was 
            seconded by Mr. Trimble and passed. The Council believed the fountain had served its purpose, and since it had 
            deteriorated over the last twenty years, it would be appropriate to have it removed. The minutes, however, did 
            not state the new location.
          </p>

          <p class="paragraph-text">Today, you can view the Public Fountain, minus the water supply, in the lawn behind the 
            Washington Fire Company on East Main Street. - Beverly J. Bone

        <p class="paragraph-text">In 1856 the first water company was established in the Borough
          of Mechanicsburg. In November of 1857 the Water Company installed
          fire plugs for the protection of the borough. At that time, the
          borough owned a hand pumper which was known as the "WASHINGTON".
          On December 29, 1857, a new fire engine arrived in the borough. It
          was known as the "LITTLE SQUIRT". That same evening the Washington
          Fire Company, one of the oldest organizations of its kind in the
          Cumberland Valley, was organized in Mechanicsburg to offer the
          people of the borough protection from fire and for the promotion
          of civic interests.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">At the organizational meeting officers were elected to govern
          the destiny of the new company. They were as follows: R. Wilson,
          President; A.N. Green, Secretary; Dr. J.B. Herring, Treasurer.
          William Mathews, Engineer; W. Dornbaugh, Assistant Engineer; and
          R.H. Thomas, D. Kimmel and.H. Dornbaugh were Directors. A committee
          was appointed to draft the fire company constitution and by-laws
          at this time. The members were as follows: A.N. Green, Joseph
          Sanderson, Dr. J.B. Herring, W.C. Houser and R.H. Thomas.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">The Fire Company was instituted on February 22, 1858, and was
          named in honor of the First President of the United States.
          Mechanicsburg, like many other progressive towns of the era,
          finally had a much—needed organized fire protection.

        <p class="paragraph-text">Anyone who was a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
          and at least 20 years of age could become a member for a fee of
          $1.00. In September of 1858 it was decided to change the minimum

        <p>Company meetings were held on Friday nights in the town hall.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">In April of 1858 the Borough purchased a hose carriage from
          the Citizen's Fire Company of Harrisburg. It was housed at the town
          hall on South Market Street with the hand pumper. It was determined
          that the hand pumper was too light to render effective service in
          an emergency in the absence of hose and hand tools. On May 25, 1858
          a new pumper was presented to the Fire Company by the Borough.
        </p>

        <p>The first Fire Company Parade was held on June 24, 1858 with

        <p>The company held its first banquet on February 22, 1859, and

          as possible.

        <p class="paragraph-text">On July 14, 1859, the foundation for a new town hall was laid
          at the corner of South Market Street and Stauffer Alley. The first
          floor was used to house the fire company equipment and the second
          floor contained a meeting room for town council.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">The first permanent fire house was built in 1860 by the fire
          company at 53 East Main Street and has been home to the Washington
          Fire Company ever since. It was known as Washington Hall. It was
          built in the center of the borough's business district on land
          owned by the Union Church. The building had three floors. On
          December 20, 1860, the company bought its first fire bell.

        <p class="paragraph-text">In July of 1869 the Fire Company purchased a hose carriage
          from the Neptune Fire Company of Philadelphia, PA, at a cost of
          $275.00 plus $5.71 in shipping charges. It is still owned by the
          Fire Company and was completely restored in 1975 at a cost of over
          $5000. Today it is valued at over $10,000. The hose carriage was
          built in the early 1820's by Young Carriage builders of
          Philadelphia. It is still pulled by company members in firemen's
          parades today. The company parade uniform consists of a red shirt,
          dark blue work pants, rubber boots and an aluminum helmet. This
          uniform represents the type of dress worn by all firemen in the
          early years of our country.

          Parade in Conshohocken.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">The company has in its possession a lot of old pictures,
          marble top tables, statues, collections of parade badges and other
          firefighting memorabilia. In the backyard there can be found the
          bells of the old Franklin Hall and Irving College. An old water
          fountain which was located in front of Franklin Hall can also be
          seen there.

        <p class="paragraph-text">The Washington Fire Company of Mechanicsburg is one of the
          oldest Fire Companies in Central Pennsylvania. It has a rich
          history of providing protection for the lives and property of the
          citizens of Mechanicsburg. They have long thought of the Washies
          as a hard—working group of men who have a certain spirit to meet
          the challenge that is brought forth at the scene of a fire or any
          other emergency. It takes a person with a great desire, probably
          even an inner need, to be challenged to the extremes of his
          personal abilities to make a good fireman. Not all fire company
          members are good firemen but there is a place in a company like the
          Washies for all those who are willing to come to the aid of their
          neighbors in any way they can.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">In recent years there has been an effort made by the
          membership of the Company to interest the youth of the Borough in
          fire fighting and the many skills which a knowledgeable fireman
          must have to go with a desire to meet a most formidable challenge
          of Life or Death! The Washies today have a large active membership
          in Cumberland County made up mostly of young men and women between
          the ages of 13 and 40. They have a great desire to learn about fire
          fighting from the fine group of experienced firemen who have worked
          to build the Company into what it is today.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-text">The Company has always been active in all civic movements in
          the community. Members of the Company have always served their
          country in the armed forces. They have come from all walks of life
          and also have been politically involved in the Borough of
          Mechanicsburg. The Washington Fire Company thanks the Borough of
          Mechanicsburg for all it has done for it and hopes to continue to
          serve the community in what ever capacity its citizen's request of
          it.

                      The Mechanicsburg Museum Association was founded in 1975 in a community effort to preserve the Stationmaster’s House, a historic Mechanicsburg landmark, from destruction. Since its founding, the Association has preserved and promoted Mechanicsburg’s unique history with educational programs, gallery exhibits, and by acquiring four more historic buildings in the area.
